The chart information file has the steps for the chart I scraped. This neededs to be entered into environment first before being able to produce data from the apis. 
The metadata collection file has the steps I have taken so far in data collection. I have used the spotify, musicxmatch, and musicbrainz apis. 
To Do: popularity, audio features, artist social media mentions, artist number of spotify followers, organize/clean/filter genre info.
